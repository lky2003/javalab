/*
    4)  An election is contested by 5 candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5
        and the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper.
        Develop an application to read the ballots and count the votes cast for each
        candidate using an array variable count. In case, a number read is outside the
        range 1 to 5, the ballot should be considered as a 'spoilt ballot' and the
        program should also count the number of spoilt ballots.

    Name of the program: _4Election.java
